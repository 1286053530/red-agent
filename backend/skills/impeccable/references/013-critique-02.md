4. If mutation is available, start `.agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/impeccable live-server --background`, present the browser if supported, label `[Human]`, scroll top, inject `http://localhost:PORT/detect.js`, wait 2-3 seconds, read `impeccable` console messages, then run `.agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/impeccable live-server stop --keep-inject`. The overlay went in through the browser, so the project's HTML has no script tag to strip; a bare `stop` also runs `live-inject --remove` against the project's entry file, an edit a read-only critique should not make.
5. For multi-view targets, inject on 3-5 representative pages.

**Desktop apps** (Electron, NW.js, CEF, WebView2): there is no URL to open, so Assessment B attaches to the running app instead.

1. Launch the app with a local DevTools port: `--remote-debugging-port=9222` (Electron, NW.js, CEF), or `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS=--remote-debugging-port=9222` for WebView2. Keep the port on 127.0.0.1 and never expose it beyond this machine; prefer a test profile and test data.
2. Seed the state under review (route, open panel, theme, data). The scan reads the window as it stands. Keep the window on screen: a minimized or hidden window scans without the pixel contrast reads.
3. Run `.agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/impeccable detect --cdp 9222 --target <part of the page URL or title> --json`. It returns the same JSON as a URL scan and leaves the page as found. With several pages open it fails and lists them; rerun with a `--target` that names one.
4. Take screenshots through the harness's CDP tooling (`Page.captureScreenshot` on the same target). Skip the live-server overlay: there is no `[Human]` tab.

The app has one window, so the assessments take turns in it instead of opening tabs (A, then B; see the sub-agent gate), and each must leave it as found: put back any route, scroll, theme, or panel it changed. Tauri on macOS (WKWebView) and on Linux (WebKitGTK) expose no CDP: run Assessment A and the source scan only, and say so in Run Notes.

Codex Browser note: Use the Browser skill. Do not spend a Browser attempt on `file://`. Only call `visibility.set(true)` after mutable script injection is confirmed for the `[Human]` overlay path; verify with `get()`. Use `tab.dev.logs({ filter: "impeccable" })` for console results. Its Playwright `evaluate(...)` surface is read-only; do not rely on it for mutation.

Return: CLI findings JSON/counts, browser console findings if applicable, false positives, and skipped/failed browser steps with concrete reasons.

After Assessment B returns usable CLI findings, reuse them. Do not rerun `impeccable detect` in the parent unless Assessment B failed, was truncated, or omitted count, rule names, or file locations.

Codex failure accounting: final Run Notes must include target slug, ignore list, assessment independence, CLI detector, browser visibility, overlay injection, live-server cleanup, temp-file cleanup, and any fallback signal used. Do not run repo status checks, late API spelunking, or unrelated verification after the report is assembled.

### Generate Combined Critique Report

Synthesize both assessments into a single report. Do not simply concatenate. Weave the findings together, noting where the LLM review and detector agree, where the detector caught issues the LLM missed, and where detector findings are false positives.

The chat response is the primary user-facing deliverable. Present the full structured critique below in chat; do not replace it with a summary and a link. The persisted snapshot is an archive of that run.

Codex final-answer note: `$impeccable critique` produces a report artifact, so the final chat response should intentionally exceed the usual concise close-out style. Do not title the final response "Critique Summary" unless the user explicitly asked for a summary.

Structure your feedback as a design director would:

#### Report header provenance

The report's first line MUST declare how the assessments were run, so a degraded run is never silent:
- Dual-agent: `Method: dual-agent (A: <agent-id> · B: <agent-id>)`
- Degraded: `⚠️ DEGRADED: single-context (<reason, e.g. no sub-agent tool exposed>)`
- Native: `Method: design review only (detector not applicable, native platform)`

#### Design Health Score
> *Consult the [Heuristics Scoring Guide](#heuristics-scoring-guide) section below.*

Present the Nielsen's 10 heuristics scores as a table:

| # | Heuristic | Score | Key Issue |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | ? | [specific finding or "n/a" if solid] |
| 2 | Match System / Real World | ? | |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | ? | |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | ? | |
| 5 | Error Prevention | ? | |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | ? | |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency | ? | |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | ? | |
| 9 | Error Recovery | ? | |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | ? | |
| **Total** | | **??/[applicable max]** | **[Rating band]** |

The applicable maximum is 4 times the number of heuristics you actually scored: **/40** when all ten apply, **/32** when two are `n/a`. Never print `/40` over a partial set.

Be honest with scores. A 4 means genuinely excellent. Most real interfaces score 20-32 out of 40.

**Mode applicability**: heuristics 7 (Flexibility and Efficiency) and 10 (Help and Documentation) may be scored `n/a` on Persuade and Experience surfaces (landing pages, campaigns, portfolios, bodies of work), as may any other heuristic that genuinely cannot apply to the surface under review. Write `n/a` in the Score cell with a one-line reason, and renormalize the total to the applicable maximum (e.g. **24/32** when two heuristics are n/a) so the rating band stays proportional. The persisted snapshot must record the applicable maximum and which heuristics were scored n/a.

#### Design Specificity Verdict

**Start here.** Does the result feel authored for this product, or category-interchangeable?

**LLM assessment**: Your unanchored evaluation of design specificity. Cover overall coherence, structural sameness, category-interchangeable choices, and missed opportunities for product character.

**Deterministic scan**: Summarize what the automated detector found, with counts and file locations. Note any additional issues the detector caught that you missed, and flag any false positives. On a native platform, write `not applicable (native platform)` instead.

**Visual overlays** (if injection succeeded): Tell the user that overlays are now visible in the **[Human]** tab in their browser, highlighting the detected issues. Summarize what the console output reported. If browser visualization was attempted but injection failed, say that no reliable user-visible overlay is available and report the fallback signal instead.

#### Overall Impression
A brief gut reaction: what works, what doesn't, and the single biggest opportunity.

#### What's Working
Highlight 2-3 things done well. Be specific about why they work.

#### Priority Issues
The 3-5 most impactful design problems, ordered by importance.

For each issue, tag with **P0-P3 severity** (see [Issue Severity below](#issue-severity-p0p3) for definitions):
- **[P?] What**: Name the problem clearly
- **Why it matters**: How this hurts users or undermines goals
- **Fix**: What to do about it (be concrete)
- **Suggested command**: Which command could address this (from: $impeccable adapt, $impeccable animate, $impeccable audit, $impeccable bolder, $impeccable clarify, $impeccable colorize, $impeccable critique, $impeccable delight, $impeccable distill, $impeccable document, $impeccable harden, $impeccable layout, $impeccable onboard, $impeccable optimize, $impeccable overdrive, $impeccable polish, $impeccable quieter, $impeccable shape, $impeccable typeset)

#### Persona Red Flags
> *Consult the [Personas reference](#persona-based-design-testing) below.*

Auto-select 2-3 personas most relevant to this interface type (use the selection table in the reference). If `AGENTS.md` contains a `## Design Context` section from `impeccable init`, also generate 1-2 project-specific personas from the audience/brand info.

For each selected persona, walk through the primary user action and list specific red flags found:

**Alex (Power User)**: No keyboard shortcuts detected. Form requires 8 clicks for primary action. Forced modal onboarding. High abandonment risk.

**Jordan (First-Timer)**: Icon-only nav in sidebar. Technical jargon in error messages ("404 Not Found"). No visible help. Will abandon at step 2.

Be specific. Name the exact elements and interactions that fail each persona. Don't write generic persona descriptions; write what broke for them.

#### Minor Observations
Quick notes on smaller issues worth addressing.

#### Questions to Consider
Provocative questions that might unlock better solutions:
- "What if the primary action were more prominent?"
- "Does this need to feel this complex?"
- "What would a confident version of this look like?"

#### Run Notes
Keep this compact. Include status for target slug, ignore list, assessment independence, CLI detector, browser visibility, overlay injection, live server cleanup, and temp-file cleanup. For failed or skipped steps, give the concrete observed reason and the fallback signal used. In the final chat response, also include snapshot write and trend read status after persistence has run.
